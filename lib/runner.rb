# Read and use the ruby docs for CSV found here [https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.5/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html]
# Within the runner.rb file, write some code that will print each row from animal_lovers.csv to the terminal.
# When youâ€™ve been able to print each row, then see if you can also print the header with the value for each row.

# If you are stuck, reference this page for help: https://backend.turing.edu/module1/lessons/csv_walkthrough
